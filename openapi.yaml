    ## Overview


    The **AlsoAsked API** offers developers access to 'People Also Ask' search
    results. This API provides insights into

    frequently asked questions related to specific search queries.


    ## Features


    With the **AlsoAsked API**, you can:


    - Conduct synchronous (waiting for completion) or asynchronous (immediate
    return with ID; updates via webhooks)
      searches.
    - Retrieve search results.

    - View your past search history.

    - Use webhooks to receive updates on search status, from start to completion
    or any failures.

    - Access account details, including the count of remaining credits.


    ## Requirements


    A **Pro subscription** is necessary to use the live API. For developers in
    the initial stages, our sandbox API

    provides a testing environment without returning actual 'People Also Ask'
    results. This allows for development and

    testing before committing to a **Pro subscription**.


    For more on the **Pro subscription**, visit our [pricing
    page](https://alsoasked.com/pricing).

        Perform a search request.


        The search request is performed either synchronously, meaning the
        request hangs until the

        search has completed, or asynchronously, meaning the request returns
        immediately, which is determined by the `async`

        request parameter.


        If the search request completes successfully, as determined by the
        `status` property, the search

        results are returned in the response body.


        Synchronous requests wait for a maximum of 90 seconds for the search to

        complete, until which point the response is returned as if it was an
        asynchronous request.

            The depth of the search determines the number of hierarchical levels
            of questions returned in the results.

            A greater depth value retrieves questions nested within additional
            layers of subquestions. Be aware that

            increasing the depth will increase the number of credits consumed. A
            search depth of 2 will consume 1 credit,

            whereas a depth of 3 will consume 4 credits.

            The async flag determines whether to run the search in a blocking
            (synchronous) or non-blocking (asynchronous)

            manner. When a search request is performed asynchronously, the
            webhooks configured for the account will be

            notified when the status of a search changes. When a search is
            synchronous, the search results are returned in

            the response body when the search is complete.

            The notify webhooks flag determines whether to notify webhooks when
            the status of a search changes. Webhooks are

            notified regardless of whether the search is performed synchronously
            or asynchronously. Use this flag to disable

            webhook notifications for synchronous searches which do not require
            webhook notifications.

                answer_excerpt: >
                  Next to potatoes, broad beans are one of the easiest staples
                  to grow. Dried broad beans, or fava beans, are

                  simply beans left in the pod until they rattle. When you've
                  had your fill of fresh, leave the rest on the

                  plant to dry. If it's wet, haul the pods indoors, to shell and
                  dry somewhere warm.

                    Broad beans can be planted out from mid-April to mid-May. If
                    you are growing them in a greenhouse, you can

                    plant them out from mid-March.

                        Broad beans prefer to be planted in the position where
                        they are to grow, but can be planted in individual

                        pots during the autumn and transplanted in to the ground
                        in the spring.

                          answer_excerpt: >
                            Broad beans are a cool season crop, so they will not
                            produce a second crop. However, you can plant

                            broad beans in the spring and again in the fall.

                      Broad beans prefer to be planted in the position where
                      they are to grow, but can be planted in individual

                      pots during the autumn and transplanted in to the ground
                      in the spring.

                    answer_excerpt: >
                      Next to potatoes, broad beans are one of the easiest
                      staples to grow. Dried broad beans, or fava beans, are

                      simply beans left in the pod until they rattle. When
                      you've had your fill of fresh, leave the rest on the

                      plant to dry. If it's wet, haul the pods indoors, to shell
                      and dry somewhere warm.

                              Next to potatoes, broad beans are one of the
                              easiest staples to grow. Dried broad beans, or
                              fava beans, are

                              simply beans left in the pod until they rattle.
                              When you've had your fill of fresh, leave the rest
                              on the

                              plant to dry. If it's wet, haul the pods indoors,
                              to shell and dry somewhere warm.

                                  Broad beans are a cool season crop, so they
                                  will not produce a second crop. However, you
                                  can plant

                                  broad beans in the spring and again in the
                                  fall.

                          - question: Do broad beans need to be dried before planting?
                            answer_excerpt: >
                              Next to potatoes, broad beans are one of the
                              easiest staples to grow. Dried broad beans, or
                              fava beans, are

                              simply beans left in the pod until they rattle.
                              When you've had your fill of fresh, leave the rest
                              on the

                              plant to dry. If it's wet, haul the pods indoors,
                              to shell and dry somewhere warm.
